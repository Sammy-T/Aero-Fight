# Aero-Fight
A mini aerial dogfighting game I created in Godot 4. It started out as an attempt to learn procedural map generation. When I got that part working I decided to build a little more on top of it.

Web version is playable at [sammy-t.itch.io/aero-fight](https://sammy-t.itch.io/aero-fight)
